/*
 * Sorte
 *
 * Sorte (just pronounced "sort") is a sorting program implementing a few different sorting algorithms.
 * Sorte takes a list of integers from stdin, sorts them, and outputs them to stdout.
 * Sorte does not feature any file handling since you can do this with pretty much any UNIX shell (ie bash).
 * Sorte is meant to be piped into Plotte, a GUI plotting program in Java.
