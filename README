# Sorte
## What is Sorte?
A sorting program implementing various algorithms in C.
It's designed to be easily usable with UNIX pipes. For example, you can pipe the results into Plotte, a plotting program.
## How do I install it?
You'll have to compile it yourself, instructions when I'm nearing a complete program.
